### PREP FOR THE EVENT

To follow this process, you need to log in with a Gmail account

#### STEP 1: Schedule the event

Schedule the event, there are multiple ways to run the Community Tech Radar. We recommend to run it in person because the value is also in the conversations that this framework enables.

##### On-line form blips data entry and in-presence consolidation (30 min)

Another option is to split the activity on the Tech Radar in 2 events a 5 mins presentation on the first one and a 30 mins discussion on the second one:

- 1st event: 5 mins introduction to the Tech Radar and the form to collect blips
- Between event 1 and 2: Share the form with the community
- 2nd event: 30 mins for consolidating blips before submission (view step 5)

##### In-presence blips data entry and consolidation in one event (45 mins)

Schedule an event with your community and set around 35/45 minutes for the Tech Radar. The agenda could look like this:

- 5 minutes presentation of the Tech Radar
- 10 mins to collect the blips - optional if you haven’t done it before the event
- 30 mins  for consolidating blips before submission (view step 5)

##### On-line form blips data entry and consolidation performed by community manager

- share an explanation of the Tech Radar
- share the online form with your community
- review answers as explained in step 5
- the community manager consolidates blips before submission (view step 5)

#### STEP 2: Register the upcoming event on GitHub

The information entered in this form will be registered in GitHub as an open issue titled like "```community name``` (```city```)" and a comment containing the other data collected from the form.

#### STEP 3: Duplicate the Tech Radar presentation

Make a copy of the presentation clicking on [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hb_Y5afNxmEe7y400Q6C3XL-1GPmNlzhuDm9CTT87qQ/copy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hb_Y5afNxmEe7y400Q6C3XL-1GPmNlzhuDm9CTT87qQ/copy)

You will see the screen below, click on “make a copy”.
Personalize the presentation and share it in the invitation.

#### STEP 4: Duplicate the form to collect the blips

Make a copy of the Google Form clicking on [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1voCX4BQkWj990jdfzLNk1OiNpDSHY-lmrp5QwvjjdLs/copy](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1voCX4BQkWj990jdfzLNk1OiNpDSHY-lmrp5QwvjjdLs/copy)

Save the form in your GDrive, personalise it as you like and share it with your community. 
You can ask to fill it before or at the event depending on the time available. Every person can submit as many blips as they want. If you want to enable advanced options (e.g. email addresses collection, editing limits, etc.), you can click on the settings icon in the form's toolbar.

#### STEP 5: Export and review answers

After the blips have been collected, go back to your Google Form, click on "Responses" and then on "Create spreadsheet" and review the answers:

* if one technology is entered with slightly different names, please pick one of them and copy it in all the linked blips
* If one blip is entered with different quadrants, choose the one that seems more appropriate
* If one blip has more than a description, please summarise them into one.
* If one blip is entered with different rings, ask the participants to vote and choose the ring that collects more of them

At the end of the process, you should have just one blip for each technology. Please remember to remove all the personal information from the final google sheet before submitting it.
